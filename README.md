# Scala Spark MLlib
Scala Spark MLlib provides a wide range of machine learning methods for various tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation. Here's a brief overview of the most common machine learning methods available in Scala Spark MLlib:

## Linear Models
### Linear Regression
A method for regression that assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.

First, you will need to import the necessary libraries:
```scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.regression.LinearRegression
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vectors
```

Next, you will need to load your data into a DataFrame. For example, let's assume you have a CSV file called ```linear_data.csv``` with two columns, x and y, containing your independent and dependent variables respectively.

```scala
val data = spark.read
    .format("csv")
    .option("header", "true")
    .option("inferSchema", "true")
    .load("linear_data.csv")
```
Then, you will need to prepare your data for modeling. In this case, we will create a new column called features that combines our x values into a vector.

```scala
val assembler = new VectorAssembler()
    .setInputCols(Array("x"))
    .setOutputCol("features")
val data2 = assembler.transform(data)
    .select($"features", $"y".alias("label"))
```
Now, we can train our linear regression model on the data:

```scala
val lr = new LinearRegression()
val model = lr.fit(data2)
```

Finally, we can use our model to make predictions on new data:

```scala
val newData = Seq(
    (Vectors.dense(5)), 
    (Vectors.dense(10)), 
    (Vectors.dense(15))
    ).toDF("features")
val predictions = model.transform(newData)
predictions.show()
```
This will output the predicted y values for the new x values of 5, 10, and 15.

### Logistic Regression
A method for binary classification that models the probability of the positive class using a logistic function.

### Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM)
A method for binary classification that finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes.

### Linear Regression with L1 or L2 Regularization (Lasso and Ridge)
A method for regression that adds an L1 or L2 penalty to the loss function to encourage sparsity or smoothness in the model coefficients.

## Tree-Based Models
### Decision Trees
A method for classification and regression that partitions the input space into regions based on simple rules learned from the data.
### Random Forests
An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees trained on random subsets of the data to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.
### Gradient Boosted Trees
An ensemble method that builds a sequence of decision trees, with each tree trying to correct the mistakes of the previous trees.

## Clustering Models
### K-Means
A method for clustering that partitions the data into k clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between points and their assigned cluster centers.
### Gaussian Mixture Models
A probabilistic model for clustering that models each cluster as a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
### Bisecting K-Means
A variant of K-Means that recursively bisects clusters to form a hierarchical clustering.

## Recommendation Models
### Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
A matrix factorization method for collaborative filtering that learns latent factors for users and items to predict user-item ratings.

## Dimensionality Reduction Models
### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
A method for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace that preserves the most variance.
### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
A method for decomposing a matrix into a product of three matrices, where the middle matrix contains the singular values that capture the most important information in the data.

## Neural Networks
### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
A feedforward neural network that consists of multiple layers of fully connected neurons, which can be trained using backpropagation with gradient descent.

## Final remarks
These are just some of the machine learning methods available in Scala Spark MLlib. The library also provides a range of preprocessing and feature extraction methods that can be used to prepare data for modeling. Additionally, many of the methods support hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to improve model performance.
